X-WR-CALNAME:The 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship
X-WR-TIMEZONE:UTC
X-WR-CALDESC:The 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship is a motor racing championship for Formula One cars which is the 73rd running of the Formula One World Championship.[a] It is recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body of international motorsport, as the highest class of competition for open-wheel racing cars. The championship is contest ed over twenty-three Grands Prix, which are held around the world, and it is scheduled to end earlier than in other recent years to avoid overlapping with the FIFA World Cup.[1][2] Drivers and teams are competing for the titles of World Drivers' Champion and World Constructors' Champion, respectively. The 2022 championship saw the introduction of significant changes to the sport's technical regulations. These changes had been intended to be introduced in 2021, but were delayed until 2022 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3] Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull Racing, is the reigning Drivers' Champion, whilst Mercedes are the reigning Constructors' Champions.[4] (copyright Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship)
